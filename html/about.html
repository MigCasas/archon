				<span class="headline">Introduction</span>
				<hr class="preline">
				<p>Archon is a democratically managed, 1vs1 Commander format. It is focused on competitive play and all changes to the format are made transparently and with the approval of the community.</p>
				<p>The members of the Council—the Archons—are elected by the community once a year. They are responsible for the proposal of all sorts of new changes to the format, as well as for providing the community with detailed explanations whenever a proposal is put up to a vote. For a change to be approved, it needs to have the approval of, at least, two thirds of the community. The details on how voting works can be found below.</p>
				<p> Every community of Archon players can also choose one of their members to be their Community Moderator. These representatives are in close contact with the Council and they can relay directly to the Archons any suggestions, concerns, or complaints their community might have.</p>
				<h2>The philosophy of Archon</h2>
				<hr class="preline">
				<p>When making decisions, both the community and the Council should keep in mind the philosophy of the format. While it can change over time, it should only ever do so via a community vote. These are the main principles of Archon:</p>
				 <ul class="a">
				  <li>Archon should be played competitively, both in tournaments and otherwise.</li>
				  <li>Archon is a 100-card singleton format. This promotes diversity in gameplay.</li>
				  <li>Commander-centric strategies are encouraged in Archon.</li>
				  <li>Access to extra mana should come at the price of meaningful resources.</li>
				  <li>The ability to interact with a particular strategy should not be limited to a minority of decks.</li>
				  <li>All changes to Archon should be made as democratically and transparently as possible.</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="headline">How does the voting work?</span>
				<hr class="preline">
				<p>Members of the community can vote on the official Archon <a href="https://discord.gg/MPqX5U6">Discord</a> server. Since we hold our votes online, there are some measures in place to ensure that no one can unfairly influence them. Thus, only people with a special Discord role are able to participate in the voting process. You can request your Community Moderator to assign this role to you. </p>
				<p>If your community is not already active on the Archon Discord, please contact one of the Archons, as they can appoint new Community Moderators and, should it be necessary, grant you the right to vote on a particular basis. In this case, you might be asked to show proof that you are an active player and a real person—for example, by showing tournament results.</p>
				<span class="headline">The Council’s Agenda</span>
				<hr class="preline">
				 <p>The Archon Council is currently working on the following points:</p>
				 <ul class="a">
				  <li>Working with the community to develop a new, fairer voting system.</li>
				  <li>Developing a system to redo votes that have already been completed in the past.</li>
				  <li>A new, updated website, as well as a tournament database.</li>
				  <li>Writing the missing ban explanations and uploading them to the website.</li>
				</ul>
				 <p>For more information, you can contact one of the Archons. You can also make suggestions on the proper text channels of the Archon Discord.</p>
