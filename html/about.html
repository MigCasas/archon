				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Archon was created as an alternative to Duel Commander.  We believe that some changes are needed to create a more competitive and fun format.  We also strongly believe that all decisions made to shape the format, be it bannings or rule changes, should be transparent and approved by the community.</p>
				<p>To get rid of this problem Archon will not have a group of people who can decided as they please on what will be changed in the format.  Instead we elect members of the community for a limited time to be part of the Archon Council.  The Archon Council can then make proposals for changes, be that cards getting added or removed from banlists or other changes to the format.  Each proposal will be well justified and afterwards be subject to a community vote.  The proposal will only be accepted if two-thirds of the votes cast are in favor of the proposal. </p>
				<p>This  is  also  why  Archon  will  not  alter  the  rules  and  bannings  in  a  functional  way  until  the  first community vote is finished.  Yet we will change the rules for Archon in a very drastic, although functional identical way compared to Duel Commander.  This is needed especially to avoid confusion and conflicts in tournaments.  </p>
				<p> To be as transparent as possible we will add to each banned card a reasoning why the card is banned. Please be patient with us,  this can take some time.  Also this is a great process to reevaluate each banned card and identify cards that could be proposed for unbanning. </p>
				<h2>The philosophy of Archon</h2>
				<p>When making decisions the community and the Archon Council should keep our philosophy in mind. This philosophy can change over time, but should only be changed via a community vote.</p>
				 <ul class="a">
				  <li>Archon should be played competitively.  Be that in tournaments or otherwise.</li>
				  <li>Archon is played as a 100 card singelton format to promote different gameplay in every game.</li>
				  <li>Archon promotes commander-centered strategies.</li>
				  <li>Gaining access to more mana then intended by the game design should only be allowed when that access is achieved by trading meaningful resources.</li>
				  <li>The ability to interact with a particular strategy should not be limited to a minority of decks played.</li>
				  <li>All changes made to Archon should be as transparent as possible.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>What is next?</h2>
				 <p>We are working at the moment on a system how the community can vote.  Also we want to represent as many communities as possible in the Archon Council, a good system to achieve this needs also be implemented.</p>
				 <p>Last  but  not  least  we  are  already  working  on  some  possible  changes  to  Archon,  but  we  want  to include as many people as possible in that process.  So if you are interested in participating do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
